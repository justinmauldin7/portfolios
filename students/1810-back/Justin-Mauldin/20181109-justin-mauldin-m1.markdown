## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

- My initial expectations going into Turing was to learn a new skill, but to thrive along the way.  After the first day though, those expectations were quickly blown to dust, and reevaluated to just learning enough to keep up and pass the mod.

- After looking back at what was an utter knock-out drag-out dog fight this past 6 weeks, I am happy to say that I was successful at having things click just in the nick-of-time.  Though, my original expectations were misaligned and unrealistic, as is a pattern through my life of expecting so much from myself, I am happy that I was able to adjust and bring my expectations back to earth to help me be successful and pass this mod, and overcome the internal struggle that held me back a lot during the 6 weeks.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

- As my comments above allude to, overcoming the obstacles in my head where the hardest part of this mod, and what I struggled the most with.  As my confidence during the 6 weeks went, so went my abilities, motivation, and ability to connect the dots, learn and progress through the material and the mod.  This is nothing new to me, as self-confidence has been something I have struggled with my whole life, but I never thought the lack of self-confidence would creep up so much and so intensely during Turing.  I have learned through mod 1, that first I can do this.  The amount of confidence I have gained this mod proves to myself I can finish the program and learn something completely new and different.  Secondly, I have learned that if I am able to live in a place where I am not in a panicked/stressed-out/discouraged, then I am more successful at learning new things.  Finally, from experiencing such a huge struggle this 6 weeks, I have learned that persevering through it all, and ultimately passing this mod and succeeding is son incredibly sweet.  I can't imagine how it will feel WHEN I finish mod 4 successfully!

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

- My favorite project was Battleship.  First, because it was interesting and fun, but mostly because I had such an amazing project partner.  I really loved working with Jennica together on that project and learning together.  Because we have very similar personalities, we were able to click right away and encourage and teach each other new things early on in the mod.

- My least favorite project was Black Thursday.  As before, I didn't like this project because of my project mates.  And I realized that it was because they were so different from myself.  I allowed more assertive and pronounced personalities take control of the project, as I shrink back further and further as we went along.  Also, we were different in that they were both very confident and more developed in their coding skills than I was, and that intimidated me and caused me to shrink back even more, compare myself to them as not getting the material, and putting a blow to my confidence.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

- In the first project, I realized just how much I was not comprehending Ruby and how behind I felt already in the mod.  That really motivated me and caused me to realize that I was not just going to put in time, work hard and going to succeed, it was going to take really hard work over the next 5 weeks to be successful.

- In the second project, I realized just how far I had come in the past 6 weeks in that I was able to get through most of the project without any help or confusion.  Just the shifting of the characters for each letter I needed help understanding and getting to work.  Also, I realize how much of a pain in the ass it is to build everything into one class, get it working, and then have to break that out into other classes.  I will not do that again!

What did you learn from your paired projects?

- From Black Thursday, I learned that for my future DTR's, I am going to make it a requirement for working with me, that I will not work past 10PM on a project.  Staying at Turing until 1AM to finish the project was not worth it to me and a lesson learned!  Also, watching other people code that are stronger than me, helped me learn tips/tricks and things that I wouldn't have learned on my own and really helped me see things that were not clicking, and then help me get to a point to where they were clicking.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

- I tried to outside of class hours and on the weekends work on projects and exercises here at Turing to be an active member of our 1810BE cohort to build those relationships and bods that are going to be so important through the next 3 mods.  Also, when I found out my former company was hiring developers, I tried to tell Zach or any other upper mod student so they knew about it and that they could reach out to me directly with questions, insight or suggestions.  I actually reached out to Laura Whitaker directly through Slack when I stopped by my old company and they had said she had applied.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

- I am really excited about the Pahlka posse getting a reboot and being a part of that group of students here at Turing.  When I graduated college, I worked at a non-profit for 2 years, and have always wanted to get back into that sector and I have already been eying a way to move my software development career in that direction post Turing.

- Next mod, and going through all the other mods, I would like to get to a place where I have enough confidence and abilities to be a bigger part of the Turing community as a resource to my cohort or a resource to lower mods as mentor, instead of being such a big consumer I felt I was this mod.
